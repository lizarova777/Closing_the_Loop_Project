# Closing the Loop

Many scholars believe that learning analytics will not demonstrate real utility until it can "Close the Loop", use data to automate decision making. A common example of this system are email generators that send emails to students in response to an activity (or lack of activity). Several universities have had some success with this strategy such as George Washington University. There are an infinite number of these lopp closing activities that could be implemented and there is a lot of work to be done understanding when they are most useful.

## Project Objective:

The purpose of this project is to build a system that autogenerates a report and emails it to yourself. The data will be retrieved from Twitter through API. The report includes the change in the number of tweets over time, the number of tweets per user, word cloud, and more. An autogenerated email will be sent if more than a hundred Tweets are returned by one's search with report attached.
